# Interpreting-Raman-spectroscopy-towards-diagnostic-purposes-
Based on Raman spectra data, this project is part of a larger project to investigate new, less intrusive and faster diagnostic methods. The purpose of this part is to suggest an interpretation of the CNN learning mechanism proposed in this paper (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-84565-3).
